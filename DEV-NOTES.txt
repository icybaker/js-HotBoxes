Develope HotBox source code in its own repo's dev branch. After 
passing standalone tests, merge with master branch and push --all 
to the origin. Then, to test compatibillity in the Suite repo, 
pull the now-up-to-date master branches into the submodules using
the command

    git submodule foreach git pull origin master

This pull will result in changes to the Suite Repo, so it's a good
idea at this point to add and commit those changes to the dev branch
of the Suite repo.


These notes define the workflow for developing HotBox compatibillity.
Each HotBox object has it's own submodule within this repository,
each submodule has a master branch and a dev branch. When working on
compatibillity, switch the repository and all submodules to the dev
branch. Changes may be made to submodule source code from here, but
only in the dev branch. After changes are committed, push them to 
the dev branch on the origin, from which the submodule's own repos
can then pull changes into it's own dev branch to test standalone
functionality before committing to the master branch. After Changes
have been committed to the master, switch back to the Suite repo,
switch submodules to their master branches and pull from origin.
Now, test compatibillity functionality. If staisfied, commit changes,
switch to master branch, merge, final test, commit, and push.
